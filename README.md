# ECPH-controller
controlling the ph and ec of aquatic environment using embedded system 
note: look in master brach as all the files are there

## Technologies and programming language 
* C
* Arduino IDE
* atmel328p, microcontroller 

## Contributors and Developers

## Issues
PID controller is not a good choise for PH controller as PH is non-linear process. 

## Improvements
Fuzzy logic controller should replace the PID controller as it is more suitable control mechanism for non-linear process like PH.
 
## Project status
On-going. There is hardwere issue as the ph sensor probe is defect.
